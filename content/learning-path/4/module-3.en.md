## Use Case

In any website that has user logins, it’s important that the site protects user accounts from unauthorized access, and also that the account credentials themselves are protected. This subtopic outlines the most common areas of authentication where web application flaws appear.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, practitioners should be able to do the following:

- Understand common types of authentication vulnerabilities
- Understand the potential impacts of those types of vulnerabilities
- Understand the mechanisms by which those vulnerabilities work
- Understand, in broad strokes, how those vulnerabilities can be prevented

---
## Main Section
Authentication is the process by which a user of a system proves that they are who they claim they are. It is the foundation upon which access control is built. Typically, a user will supply a piece of information that identifies them (username, email address, phone number, etc.) and a piece of secret information that validates that identity (commonly a password or passphrase, though alternative or additional methods such as a security keys, WebAuthn, and Passkeys are gaining popularity). This subtopic will cover a few vulnerability classes that are common and high-impact in web applications.

### Insecure password storage

If users are to log in to a site with a username and a password, the site must be able to validate that the user entered the correct password. Passwords must furthermore be stored securely in the application’s authentication database, because that database might be compromised due to SQL injection, lost backups, or even malicious or compromised members of the organization running the site. There are several approaches to storing passwords:

- **Plaintext** \
  This is obviously the worst way to store passwords. It means to store the exact characters that the user typed in when setting up the password. If the password database is compromised, attackers will have full access to all user passwords. Not only can these passwords be used to gain access to the website itself, but they can be used in [password reuse attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing) against other sites or applications.
- **Encrypted** \
  The obvious solution to plaintext password storage is to encrypt the passwords. However, this offers only modest protection against many threats. The application itself must know the encryption key, and so the key must be stored somewhere. Malicious or compromised insiders with access to the database almost certainly will have access to the encryption key. Also, there are a variety of common web server vulnerabilities that could allow remote attackers to gain access to the key. Once somebody obtains the encryption key, they would be able to figure out the passwords.
- **Hashed** \
  As it turns out, the web server never needs to retrieve a user password from storage, it merely needs to know if the password that the user entered was the same as the user’s real password. There is a class of algorithms referred to as [cryptographic hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) that perform a one-way transformation on data. Examples of these algorithms include MD5 and SHA. It is effectively impossible to, given a hash, determine what source data generated the hash. Unfortunately, passwords tend to be fairly short, and cryptographic hash functions tend to be quite fast. For a given hash function, it is possible to hash every possible password of a given length and store the resulting password and hash. Then, given a particular password hash, one can simply look up the password that generated this hash. In the mid 2000s, it was feasible to compute, store, and distribute these databases, called [rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table), for general use. \
  One solution to the rainbow table problem is to add a bit of data ([called a salt](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)>)) to the password before hashing it. This data doesn’t need to be secret or particularly high-entropy, it just needs to be different per user. A common approach is to hash the username and the password together. A rainbow table for Microsoft Windows NTLM password hashes up to 9 characters long takes up 6.7 TB. If those password hashes were salted with even 5 alphanumeric characters, that rainbow table would grow to over 6,000,000,000 TB. The problem with this approach is that hashes are still quite fast, and modern graphics cards are essentially massively parallel supercomputers. An Nvidia RTX 4090 (a high-end video card from 2022) can compute almost 400,000,000,000 salted SHA hashes a second, allowing private individuals to crack most passwords in minutes or hours.

**Special password storage algorithms** \
The problem with cryptographic hashes is that they are designed to be fast and efficient. Most of their use is in verifying that data hasn’t been tampered with. This problem had been addressed as early as 1976, with a [Unix crypt function](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix99/full_papers/provos/provos_html/node9.html) that salted and encrypted the password multiple times to slow down brute-forcing. Unsurprisingly, this algorithm will not stand up to modern computing resources, but the general idea is still used today with special algorithms that are designed to store password derivatives. These algorithms are designed to take tunable CPU and memory resources, to make a good tradeoff between performance and brute-force resistance. Good password handling algorithms include (in decreasing order of preference) [scrypt, argon2, bcrypt, and PBKDF2](https://www.latacora.com/blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers/). As a defense-in-depth measure, it’s a good practice to combine the user’s password with a secret that’s not stored in the database itself. For example, the secret can be hard-coded in the application itself. This will likely prevent password recovery if only the password database is lost.

#### Try it yourself!

Log into your DVWA and make sure the security level is set to low. Navigate to the SQL Injection section, and enter the following into the text box: \
 \
`​​999' union all select user, password from users where '1'='1`

This will return the first and last names of all users who have a `userid` of 999 (there are none), and also the username and password hash for all users. Use an online hash lookup site (e.g. [https://www.whatsmyip.org/hash-lookup/](https://www.whatsmyip.org/hash-lookup/)) to look up the admin user’s password hash. What kind of hash is used to store the DVWA users’ passwords? What is the password of the user named “1337”?

For more information on password handling, see the [OWASP password storage cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html).

### Password reset

If the user on a website forgets their password, most sites provide an automated way for the user to verify their identity in order to set a new password. Ideally, these methods are approximately as secure as the standard password verification process in which the user types in a secret password they know into a webpage, but are significantly less convenient.

Most sites will assume that the user’s email account is reasonably secure and email the user a link that will allow them to reset their password. This assumption is probably correct for the vast majority of user accounts on the vast majority of websites. Password reset links (and, additionally, “magic login” links) should have the following properties in order to minimize user risk:

- The links should be to the TLS encrypted version of the site. (Note that there is no feasible way to guarantee that the email itself is encrypted in transit, but end-user network traffic, such as a user accessing a webpage, is more likely to be intercepted than traffic between servers, such as emails sent from one server to another.)
- The link should have an access token that contains around 128 bits of randomly-generated data from a cryptographically strong random number generator. Note that 128 bits of data will take up 172 or more characters when encoded into a URL. There is no real advantage to using more than 128 bits of data, and using 128 bits means that no additional brute-force protection is required.
- The access token should be time-limited (e.g. expire after an hour) and single-use. The single-use nature not only limits the ability of an attacker to change a user’s password, but also may alert the user in the case that an attacker manages to obtain the token and change the user’s password.
- The token itself must be tied to the user’s account, preventing users from using the token to change another user’s password.

Reset links may also be sent via SMS. SMS is less likely to be intercepted than email by normal hackers, but is vulnerable to interception by governments in the country that the user is in. If a shorter token (e.g. a PIN) is sent via SMS, then it is important to have strong brute-force protection on the page that accepts the PIN, e.g. a 10 minute PIN lifetime and rate-limiting. Note as well that there are both [money-making and simple DoS attacks](https://www.openmindnetworks.com/blog/international-sms-fraud-by-brian-kelly-cto-and-co-founder/) that involve causing a server to send SMS messages to a phone number of an attacker’s choosing. By performing a large number of SMS password resets, an attacker can incur high costs for the website operator, potentially making money for themselves in the process.

An alternate method of performing password resets involves asking the user questions that both the website and user know the answers to, but that an attacker might not. These tend to be extremely weak, or extremely strong methods of verifying the user’s identity. Standard “secret questions” like asking where the user was born, their mother’s maiden name, the make of their first car, etc. are quite weak. First off, an attacker may be able to easily find the answer to those questions. Secondly, most of them are impossible to change, so in the event that an attacker does discover an answer (even by compromising another website), they will be able to use them again and again. Lastly, most of these questions only have a handful of common answers. For example, if you ask a Korean person their mother’s maiden name, a significant proportion of the answers will be “Kim” or “Lee”. The other, more secure type of secret question involves offline communications between the website and the user. Examples of this are things like utility bills and bank statements. For the user to reset their password, they would enter, for instance, the amounts of 3rd and 5th transactions in their bank statement. The user would only be allowed a few tries, and then would need to perform an even less convenient reset process with customer service. This reset process can be very secure, though in the days of online statements, it’s probably less secure than emailing a token.

### Credential strength

Most web applications use passwords for authentication, though techniques like WebAuthentication using security keys and extremely long lived authentication sessions combined with login links via email are gaining popularity. If a website uses passwords, it’s important that those passwords be strong. However, the definition of a “strong” password has shifted over the years. There are three primary methods that attackers uses to directly attack user passwords:

1. **Online guessing using password reuse** In this attack, an attacker uses known passwords associated with the user, and simply tries those passwords in the site’s login form. Since many people use the same passwords across multiple websites, this attack can be devastatingly effective. Usernames and passwords from compromised sites are widely available on the public web, dark web, and for sale on private websites. Attackers can simply enter all the known passwords for a given user; if the attacker is targeting a small number of users, this attack doesn’t even require automation.
2. **Online brute-force via credential stuffing** “Credential stuffing” is a type of attack where a software client (either a scripted web browser via something like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) or a custom script) will automatically attempt to log in to the target site. Additionally, these attacks can use a distributed set of proxy servers to appear to come from a variety of different computers. The rate of these attacks is generally limited by the speed of the web server and network latency, so attackers will generally be careful to choose only the most likely credentials to try. For instance, they will often limit the usernames to a targeted set, or to known good usernames if there is a [username enumeration vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account) on the site. (Note that in most cases, preventing username enumeration is defense in depth, and should not be a high priority for web applications.) Additionally, the attacker will attempt to prioritize likely passwords, using passwords dumps to try reused passwords, and trying commonly-used passwords.
3. **Offline brute-force** If the attacker managed to acquire a copy of the application’s passwords database (for example via SQL injection), they will likely attempt to brute-force the stored credentials. Depending on how the credentials are stored and the attacker’s hardware capabilities, attackers may be able to try hundreds of trillions of passwords per second, or hundreds. In any case, once the attacker has the password database, the application cannot detect or stop the attack. Attackers will generally prioritize likely passwords in this attack, but if they are very well funded or if the password storage algorithm is weak, the attacker can start enumerating all possible passwords.

Of these attacks, the online attacks are much more common. Ideally, applications would not be vulnerable to SQL injections, insiders would not get compromised or act maliciously, and database backups would never be lost. However, it would be irresponsible to ignore the possibility of an offline attack. Given this, the priorities of a web application should be (in order):

1. **Prevent password reuse, especially with known compromised passwords** This is impossible to do completely, and also can present user interface issues. However, there are services such as those from [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) (English, [subscriptions for API use start at US$40/year](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key)), [Hold Security](https://holdsecurity.com/solutions/credential-integrity-service/), [SpyCloud](https://spycloud.com/products/consumer-ato-prevention/), etc that can tell you if a particular username and password have appeared in a password dump. [Password dump compilations](https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/) can also be downloaded and checked locally.
2. **Prevent the use of common passwords** Pages that allow users to set their password should compare the user’s password against a list of the most common passwords (usually obtained from password dumps). Some of those lists are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials). Note that attackers will use the same lists, so merely blocking the 100 or 1000 most common passwords is unlikely to be very effective.
3. **Ensure passwords have enough entropy to resist brute-force attacks** Even though something like “w)\*l3” is not a common password, it will be quickly discovered in a brute-force attack. Setting a minimum password length can help mitigate brute-force attacks.

Of course, these priorities must be balanced against the requirements of the user to either use a password manager or to remember their password. Also, passwords as an authentication method are fairly problematic; the next section covers multifactor authentication and password alternatives.

For more information on password strength, see [this summary of the US Government’s NIST authentication guidelines](https://blog.netwrix.com/2022/11/14/nist-password-guidelines/).

### Multifactor Authentication

As you may have surmised from the previous section, password security is very difficult. It gets worse when you consider social engineering attacks such as phishing.

#### Phishing and Related Attacks

[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) is one of a class of social engineering attacks that attackers use to attack individuals. Although phishing can have many aims (such as convincing users to install malware on their computer or transfer money to attackers), the goal we care about is stealing users’ passwords. Although phishing usually refers to attacks launched via email, similar techniques can be used over a variety of communications mediums, such as SMS, WhatsApp, Signal, and even QR codes.

In a typical credential phishing campaign, attackers will send emails to their victims purporting to be sent from a legitimate website. The email will contain a call to action (such as requiring a password change or acknowledging a notification) with a link to an attacker-controlled website that has a legitimate-looking login page. If a victim clicks the link, and then enters their password on the website, the site sends their password to the attacker. (For much more on phishing, see the [Investigating Malicious Infrastructure Learning Path](/en/learning-path/1/).)

Phishing attacks are extremely low cost for attackers, and tend to be extremely effective. Once the attacker has the victim’s password, they can log into the target website as the victim. With preparation, the attacker can use automation to immediately perform actions on the victim’s account, including changing the user’s email address and password to lock the victim out of their own account.

Given the danger of phishing attacks, and the complete inability to password authentication to stop phishing, any multifactor authentication scheme should be evaluated against its phishing resistance.

#### Multifactor Authentication Overview

Traditionally, there are three types of things (called factors) that can be used for authentication:

- **Something you know** The most common form of this is the password; it is a thing that you (and hopefully only you) know. This is very popular because it’s very easy to generate a secret password, and generally easy to change.
- **Something you have** The most common form of this is a key; it is a thing that you have that is hard to reproduce. This is less popular because it’s easy to lose, hard to set up initially, and hard to change.
- **Something you are** The most commonly-known form of this is a fingerprint, but facial recognition is increasingly popular; it’s something intrinsic to you. These are surprisingly easy to “lose” (such as a burn damaging fingerprints, extremely difficult to change intentionally, and verification tends to be error prone.

MFA (multifactor authentication) combines two or more of these factors together to strengthen a system’s authentication system. There are many examples of multifactor authentication in everyday life. Using an ATM requires something you have (the card) and something you know (your PIN). Many building access control systems have a badge to open a door, but that badge also brings up the badge holder’s face on a display that a guard can see, combining something you have (the badge) with something you are (your face).

In the remainder of this subsection, we’ll discuss a variety of common web MFA methods.

#### Secret Questions

Although this is technically not MFA (it combines multiple things that the user knows), it was very popular in the past, and is still in use in many contexts. Using secret questions as part of authentication does provide some degree of defense against password reuse and password guessing attacks. Beyond that, it provides very little protection. It is almost worthless against phishing. The attacker’s website can simply attempt to log into the real website, and then turn around and ask the user the secret questions. Additionally, as discussed in the Password Reset subsection above, the secret question answers are frequently guessable. For these reasons, secret questions are not a strong MFA method.

#### SMS Codes

An actual MFA method in common use is to text the user a code when they log in, then require that code to complete the login process. This combines something the user knows (their password) with something they have (the phone that receives messages at a certain number). Unfortunately, SMS codes are almost worthless against phishing. When the user logs into the attacker controlled fake website, the fake website will log into the real website. The real website will text the user, and the user then enters the code into the fake website. The fake site then uses the code on the real site, and is then logged in as the victim. Additionally, [SIM swapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam) attacks can allow attackers to take over a victim’s phone number, allowing the attacker to receive SMS messages intended for the victim. For these reasons, SMS codes are not a strong MFA method for sensitive or important websites.

#### TOTP

TOTP stands for Time-based One-Time Password. To initiate the system, the server and a device controlled by the user exchange a cryptographic secret (the “seed”) and synchronize their clocks. Then, when a user wishes to authenticate to a website, the user’s device performs a cryptographic operation on the seed and the current time, generating a code that’s only good for seconds or minutes. The server performs the same operation, and uses that to check the user’s code. In the past, the most common TOTP system was RSA SecureIDs, which were expensive. Now, most TOTP systems run on smartphones. Examples include Google Authenticator and Authy. Regardless, TOTP functions as something you have (the TOTP seed) for purposes of authentication.

Like SMS codes, TOTP is also vulnerable to phishing. The attacker-controlled fake site can simply ask the user for their TOTP code and use it to log into the real site. For this reason, TOTP is not a strong MFA method for sensitive or important websites. Also note that if a user loses or wipes their phone, they are unlikely to be able to authenticate to the site, as they have lost their TOTP seed.

#### Security Keys

Security keys (sometimes referred to as U2F, FIDO, WebAuthentication, Yubikeys, etc) are devices that implement a [cryptographic authentication protocol](https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Protocol_details/Overview.html). When you register a security key with a website, the site and the security key exchange public keys. For subsequent authentication, the server presents a signed challenge to the device. The device verifies the site’s signature, and then responds with a signed response. Finally, the server verifies the device’s signature. This proves to the server that you are in possession of the key that was registered initially, making it something you have. Traditionally, security keys were stand-alone devices that talked to a computer or mobile device over USB or NFC, although support for using smartphones and computers is available in some configurations.

Unlike the other MFA discussed here, security keys are resistant to phishing. The key here is that the signed challenge includes the identity of the website requesting authentication. For a valid site, this will match an existing site key on the device. For a lookalike attacker-controlled site, the site will not match any existing site key, and so no MFA will take place. So, the attacker may have the user’s password, but they will not be able to complete authentication to the target website, as there’s no way for the attacker to complete the MFA process. On the minus side, security keys can be lost. Generally, sites that use security keys will allow users to register multiple keys, so that if one is lost or damaged, a back-up can be used.

#### Single-use passwords

Pre-generated single use passwords are sometimes used as a backup for other MFA methods, and were [used for high-security applications](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-typical-one-time-password-OTP-scheme-used-by-European-banks-Stahlberg-2007-p-2_fig3_49279643) before the widespread use of smartphones. Modern websites will frequently refer to these as “backup codes.” The server will generate a list of codes, store them, and present them to the user. The user would generally print them out and store the paper in a secure location. Each time a code is used, it is marked as invalid by the server. These are subject to the same weaknesses as TOTP, but have a perverse advantage of being very inconvenient. As such, they are frequently used as a backup for other MFA methods. The hope is that their use is rare enough that, if a user is prompted to enter a backup code, they will stop and highly scrutinize the requesting website, making a phishing attack less likely to succeed. Examples of sites using backup codes are [Gmail](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1187538?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication-recovery-methods).

For a bit more authentication, see [the OWASP authentication cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html) and [the OWASP MFA cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Multifactor_Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html). For an in-depth exploration, see the [Web Application Security Assessment learning path](/en/learning-path/5/).

### Session fixation

[Session fixation](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation#:~:text=Session%20Fixation%20is%20an%20attack,specifically%20the%20vulnerable%20web%20application.) is an important concept in web security. It refers to an attack where an attacker sets a user's session identifier (session ID) to a value known to the attacker. This can occur through various means, such as phishing attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the web application. The attack involves acquiring a valid session ID, persuading a user to authenticate with it, and then taking over the session by leveraging the known session ID. This requires the attacker to supply a genuine web application session ID and manipulate the targeted person’s browser into using it. They can then hijack the user's session, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.

Session fixation exploits weaknesses in how a web application manages session IDs. Essentially, the vulnerable application fails to assign a new session ID during user authentication, enabling the attacker to utilize an existing session ID. Unlike Session Hijacking, which occurs after user login, Session Fixation establishes control over a session before user authentication.

Various techniques can be used to execute this attack, depending on how the web application handles session tokens:

1. Session token in the URL argument: The attacker sends the Session ID to the victim via a hyperlink, leading the victim to access the site through the malicious URL.
2. Session token in a hidden form field: The attacker tricks the targeted person into authenticating on the target web server using a login form developed by the attacker, potentially hosted on an illegitimate server or within an HTML-formatted email.
3. Session ID in a cookie:

- Client-side script: Utilizes client-side scripting to inject malicious code, often via Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks, into a hyperlink, fixing a Session ID in the targeted person’s cookie using the document.cookie function.
- &lt;meta> tag: Another form of code injection attack, which is more potent than XSS as it cannot be readily disabled or denied by browsers.
- HTTP header response: Exploits server responses to embed the Session ID in the victim's browser by including the "Set-Cookie" parameter in the HTTP header response.

Many web frameworks and libraries offer features to aid developers in implementing secure session management, which helps to mitigate session fixation vulnerabilities. These frameworks often include built-in mechanisms for generating, storing, and validating session IDs. They may allow for configuring session expiration, regenerating session IDs upon authentication, and ensuring secure transmission of session data. However, it could be useful for developers to effectively implement these practices within their application code as well, ensuring proper configuration and usage to mitigate session fixation and other vulnerabilities. Regular updates to libraries and frameworks are crucial, as they may contain patches or improvements related to session management security.

#### Preventing Session Fixation Vulnerabilities

For most web server administrators, the best way of mitigating for session fixation vulnerabilities is to make sure that the software stack you use for authentication contains mitigations against such attacks and also up to date. If you are using a library which has a vulnerability which allows for session fixation, make sure to upgrade it as soon as you can.

Web apps, libraries, and frameworks take several steps to mitigate session fixation attacks. Those include generating random session IDs for each user session, expiring sessions after a period of inactivity, and implementing measures like session ID regeneration upon authentication. Your web app should always be using HTTPS for security and privacy, and it likewise offers an additional layer of protection against session fixation attacks: it’s much harder to intercept session IDs in transit if communication between the client and server is encrypted. Finally, your web app should also reject externally imposed session tokens, which will also help protect against this type of attack.

If you are going to be coding a web app with authentication capabilities, we recommend that read through [this article](https://secureteam.co.uk/2018/11/25/understanding-session-fixation-attacks/) and implement the following measures it recommends, which help protect the web application against session fixation attacks:

1. Avoid accepting Session IDs via GET or POST parameters, as this mitigates the risk of exploitation by minimizing reliance on browser vulnerabilities. Additionally, all Session IDs should be server-generated, eliminating any need for client-proposed Session IDs.
2. Post-login, initiate a Session ID change by generating a new one on the server and updating it as a cookie. Concurrently, invalidate any existing session associated with the user.
3. Incorporate a logout functionality empowering users to terminate their sessions promptly, thereby ensuring immediate server-side session termination instead of merely deleting the browser cookie. Additionally, implement session expiration mechanisms to automatically invalidate session data after a predefined time-lapse, thus limiting the window of opportunity for attackers to leverage compromised sessions.


## Practice

### Exercise 1: Broken access controls

Go to the Try Hack Me website, create an account, and go through the room called [OWASP Broken Access Control](https://tryhackme.com/room/owaspbrokenaccesscontrol) and follow the instructions.

### Exercise 2: Using rainbow tables to better understand insecure password storage mechanisms (optional)

Note: _while this exercise provides a great learning opportunity on how adversaries could crack badly secured passwords, it does require quite a bit of free disk space and uses a tool which is only available on Windows and Linux. Since not all learners might be able to do this practice exercise, we have marked it as clearly optional. We encourage learners who want to learn more about rainbow tables and secure password storage, both those who can and cannot do the below exercise, to consult further reading through posts such as [this one](https://cybr.com/certifications-archives/hash-tables-rainbow-table-attacks-and-salts/)._

When authenticating users we need a way to verify whether they entered correct credentials. The easiest way of doing that is to store the password itself in a database. This is insecure, as anyone with access to that database could learn users’ plaintext passwords, and they would be revealed in case of a leak or application vulnerability. A simple protection can be implemented by storing a [hash value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the password instead. This exercise will demonstrate how easy it is to break such protection and learn plaintext passwords from hashed values. **The point of this exercise is not to make learners believe that all authentication mechanisms can be easily broken but rather to demonstrate how easy it is to break passwords which have only been hashed without any additional security mechanisms such as salting.**

[Rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) are a smart way of reducing computation time in exchange for disk space when trying to brute-force a hashed password. They consist of pre-calculated chains of hashes that can be used to discover a hashed value (the plaintext password).

#### The exercise

Given the hash value of `168f3c743786fea2e04aeeee33e112da` , try to discover the password using rainbow tables. 🌈 Use RainbowCrack ([http://project-rainbowcrack.com/](http://project-rainbowcrack.com/)). The easiest way to run RainbowCrack might be to use Kali Linux ([https://www.kali.org/](https://www.kali.org/)) in a VM or booted from a LiveUSB (refer to the links in _Basic information_ section at the beginning of this learning path for more info). The hashing algorithm is MD5 and the hash is unsalted.

_Hint:_ the password is lowercase alphanumeric, max. 6 characters. Once you’ve installed RainbowCrack you can use the following command to generate the required table:

```
rtgen md5 loweralpha-numeric 1 6 0 3800 1000000 0
```

_(Optional)_ Try to use the generated table to break another hash: `feadfd87d487818698d63aedf385c4e2`.

_Hint:_ If that fails you can try to generate more tables to increase the success rate of your table set (coverage). Just change the fifth parameter of the `rtgen` command to different values (try 1-5).

Try to break the following salted hash: `93e99d25dd6e8f524f23814908b6c039`

#### The walkthrough

Generating a rainbow table requires specifying a hash algorithm to use, maximum length of the plaintext values were interested in and their character set. Those parameters only influence the time it takes for a table to be generated (amount of computation required).

Tables for shorter passwords with smaller character sets (eg. only lowercase letters) will take a shorter time to generate than tables for long passwords with numbers and special characters.

Additionally, you need to choose how many chains to generate and of what length. Those parameters are more complex to explain (see [Philippe Oechslin's whitepaper](https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2003/27290615/27290615.pdf) for more background) but have effects on coverage of the table. Only a subset of all possible plaintext values is included in each rainbow table.

The bigger the values of these parameters, the larger and more costly (in terms of CPU time) the table is, but also the more plaintext values can be discovered using it.

Pre-calculated tables for different hash functions, password lengths and character sets can be downloaded from the Internet (eg. [https://freerainbowtables.com/](https://freerainbowtables.com/)) or obtained at IT security conferences and hacker camps (see [https://dcddv.org/](https://dcddv.org/)). For the purposes of this exercise we'll generate our own!

You can install rainbowcrack on your system or use Kali Linux Live. For Kali, open a terminal window and run:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rainbowcrack
```

This will install the software. You can use the `rtgen` command to generate tables. According to [its manual](http://project-rainbowcrack.com/generate.htm) the command takes quite a few parameters:

```
rtgen hash_algorithm charset plaintext_len_min plaintext_len_max table_index chain_len chain_num part_index
```

We'll use MD5 as our hash algorithm. We'll be looking for passwords of length from 1 to 6 characters. We'll use the `loweralpha-numeric` charset, which includes lowercase letters and numbers only. We're going to use 3800 for chain length, 1000000 for number of chains.

To generate our first table run:

```
sudo rtgen md5 loweralpha-numeric 1 6 0 3800 1000000 0
```

This command might take a while to execute, depending on your system configuration.

After generation, one more step is required before we can use our new tables:

```
sudo rtsort
```

This will sort the data to make using the table faster. `rtcrack` will refuse to work with unsorted tables.

Let's take a crack at our first hash:

```
rcrack . -h 168f3c743786fea2e04aeeee33e112da
```

This should take just a moment and reveal our plaintext password:

```

We didn't find our hash in this table. Let's generate a few more tables with the hope of increasing our coverage. We'll use the same `rtgen` command, only changing the `table_index` parameter:

```
sudo rtgen md5 loweralpha-numeric 1 6 1 3800 1000000 0
sudo rtgen md5 loweralpha-numeric 1 6 2 3800 1000000 0

sudo rtgen md5 loweralpha-numeric 1 6 5 3800 1000000 0
sudo rtsort .
```

rcrack . -h feadfd87d487818698d63aedf385c4e2

Got it! Additional tables increased the coverage and the hash was found out.

An improvement on using simple hashing for password protection is called “salting” the hashes – adding an application-specific secret to the plaintext value. That increases the length and character set of the hashed value, making a rainbow table approach infeasible. Trying the third (salted) hash given in this exercise will fail with this method as it would require rainbow tables bigger than can be currently generated (and stored).
