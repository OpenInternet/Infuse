## Use Case

If a website comes under a sustained denial of service attack, it may be vital to act quickly to get the site back up and running. This subtopic describes some practices to allow site owners to recover from a DoS attack.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, the practitioner should be able to do the following:

- Determine what sort of DoS attack a website is under
- Mitigate or neutralize an attack in process

---
## Main Section
For some sites (e.g., gambling sites), even a brief DoS can be an existential threat to the site’s survival. Attackers are typically financially motivated, and will use DoS as an extortion threat. For civil society focused sites, the threat model is typically quite different. Attacks are typically controlled by political rivals (often nation-state actors or those linked to or supported by them), and fall into two categories:

- Brief (hours to days) attacks meant to intimidate the site owners
- Sustained attacks designed to permanently silence the site

At the start of an attack, it’s impossible to know which type of attack the site is under. Fortunately, the technical and operational response is the same. The basic response breaks down to three steps:

1. Determine what kind of attack the site is under
2. Mitigate that attack (the site should be operational at this point)
3. Proactively harden the site against future attacks

### Determining Attack Type

Generally, a DoS attack will be noticed when users note that the site becomes unavailable or shows degraded performance. In some cases, performance monitoring systems for the site may proactively notify site owners. In any case, the first step is to determine why the site is down. Note that degraded site performance or a site being unavailable may not be due to an attack, but due to equipment failures, misconfiguration, ill-conceived site changes, and [something on the site going viral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect). When investigating site degradation, keep in mind the types of DoS attacks, and their symptoms:

- Network-Level
  - Volumetric - Network diagnostic tools such as ping will show high packet loss and long round trip times. If the website is hosted at an ISP or web hosting service, other sites hosted by that ISP/hosting service will also be unavailable.
  - Exploit-based - Network diagnostic tools will tend to show high packet loss, but often will show normal round trip times. If the website is hosted at an ISP/hosting provider, other sites hosted by them will also be unavailable.
- Protocol-Level
  - Volumetric - Network diagnostic tools will typically show elevated packet loss and round trip times. Browser requests to the site will typically take a long time, and usually time out. If the website is hosted at a web hosting provider, other sites hosted on the same server will likely be unavailable, while ones hosted on other servers will typically work. Note that volumetric protocol level DoS attacks will find any bottleneck, be it in the network or server. For instance, a protocol-level attack against a powerful server on an underpowered network will affect the network more than the server.
  - Exploit-based - Network diagnostic tools will typically show normal packet loss and round trip times. Browser requests to the site may either be very slow, or may quickly return an error. If the website is hosted at a web hosting provider, other sites hosted on the same server will likely be unavailable, while ones hosted on other servers will typically work.
- Application-Level
  - Network diagnostic tools will typically show normal packet loss and round trip times. Static content served by the site may behave normally, or may also be degraded. If the website is hosted at a web hosting provider, other sites hosted on the same server will likely be unavailable, while ones hosted on other servers will typically work.

Knowing what kind of attack is happening will help guide site owners’ response. If any sort of network or protocol level attack is suspected, it’s important to reach out to the sites’ ISP/hosting provider to help diagnose the problem. They will usually have access to better diagnostic and response tools for network and protocol level attacks.

A word of warning, a DoS attack against a website is usually necessarily an attack against that site’s ISP/hosting provider as well. Especially for network level attacks, the ISP may be impacted just as much as the target website. For this reason, [ISPs or hosting providers will sometimes shut down websites that are targeted by DoS attacks](https://www.qurium.org/alerts/azerbaijan/ddos-the-inconvenient-business-visitor/), so as to protect the provider itself. Engaging with the site’s ISP/hosting provider early may hopefully provide you with some negotiation possibilities or coordination if the provider does decide to shut a site down.

### Mitigating the threat

Depending on the type of attack, and the hosting service for the site, mitigations can be varied.

#### Exploit-based attacks

For network and protocol level denial of service exploits, generally a software update will need to be applied. As a short-term mitigation, the site’s ISP may block sources of malicious traffic until software updates can be applied.

#### Volumetric attacks

For network and protocol level volumetric attacks, the response is generally carried out at the ISP level. Usually, the ISP will analyze incoming network traffic and identify sources of malicious traffic. They will then block those sources at the network level and work with their upstream ISP to block those sources as well. Eventually, the upstream ISPs that are blocking malicious traffic are large enough that they can easily handle the level of malicious traffic being generated, and the downstream ISPs (and target site) are able to resume normal operations.

#### Application-level attacks

For application-level DoS attacks, mitigation is generally handled by the site owner, as opposed to the ISP or hosting provider. Generally, the attacker will be sending a large volume of requests, often of an unusual nature, to a specific endpoint on the site. This endpoint (i.e., web page) will be consuming a huge amount of resources, slowing down or crashing the site.

The best place to start looking for the targeted endpoint is the web server’s access logs. If you can connect to the web server via something like SSH, try to download (e.g. via rsync or scp) some current access logs, and some from before the attack started. Look for pages that are being hit more frequently, pages that are returning a lot of data, or pages that are taking a lot of time to finish processing. Note that a good logging setup (as described in subsection 2) can make all of this much easier.

If you can’t get access to the logs but have access to a development copy of the site, you can try to find the targeted endpoint yourself. Go through the site, looking for pages that could consume a lot of resources. Examples might include pages that perform complex database queries, read files off the filesystem, resize images, make requests to other websites, etc. A full discussion of this is outside the scope of this learning path, but might include a look at some vulnerabilities included as part of the [Web Security Assessment learning path](/en/learning-path/5).

If you do manage to find the likely target endpoint, whether by reading logs or simulating an attacker, the next step is to figure out how to thwart the attack. The quickest is to just replace that page on the site with a static web page. This will stop the attack but will disable part of the site. Also, if the attack leverages something that’s on many or all pages on the site, that fix may break the site.

A better option would be to put limits on the target endpoint to prevent it from consuming so many resources. If it’s a page that resizes images, put in a maximum image size. If it’s a search operation and the attacker is using a very long and complex search query, limit the length of the query. If it’s a search and the attacker has put in a search that returns lots and lots of results, change the query to be in a sub-select that limits the number of rows before any sorting etc is done. Hopefully, a simple change can render the attack ineffective without changing how the site works for non-malicious users.

#### If the site is shut down

If the DoS attack is successful in shutting down the web site (e.g., the hosting provider turns off the site), getting the site back up may happen several different ways. If the site owners have good development and deployment practices (see subsection 1 of this learning path), they may have a development copy of the site ready to be deployed at another hosting provider. If not, you and the site owners may be able to negotiate with the site’s current hosting provider to get access to the production servers and copy the site data off.

The easiest next step may be to generate a completely static copy of the site and host it on something like GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, or GCP GCS buckets. To generate a static copy of the site from a development version, you can use a tool like [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/) to “spider” the web site and download the HTML. The static site hosting services mentioned above are all free or inexpensive (though there may be a cost for TLS), [are DoS resistant](https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/), and can be set up in a matter of minutes. While having a static copy of the site up may not be ideal, it can be a good stopgap measure.

### Recovering from a DoS Attack

Once the attack has been mitigated, the site owner can work on a full recovery. Generally this involves going through the processes of preparing the site described in subsections 1 and 2 of this learning path. Often, once a site is targeted by a DoS attack, it is likely to face similar attacks again in the future. As such, careful preparation is very important. Especially if an application-level attack was used, it’s a good idea to go through the site and its code to find any aspects that could consume a large amount of resources, and modify them to limit the resources they could consume. Also, having an easy way to generate a static copy of the site and a rehearsed procedure to switch the site to static site hosting, could be useful for frequently-targeted sites.
