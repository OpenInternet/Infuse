## Use Case

This module will teach you how to **interpret and understand malicious emails** and **find the infrastructure that they link to**. Whether they be pure social engineering, phishing, or malware delivery, malicious emails can be quite complex. While the immediate goal of this skill is to identify attacker infrastructure, these advanced skills of reversing complex emails are also good preparation for understanding attacker campaigns, and they are a good introduction to analyzing more complicated malware. Some of those techniques can also **help you analyze suspicious messages sent through other mediums, such as WhatsApp**.

Note that during active investigation, you may have to perform actions that will alert the attacker to the investigation (or at least that someone is interacting with their trap). Consider whether or not this is an acceptable cost to completing an investigation.

It is best to do this type of analysis from a virtual machine or dedicated device. For added protection, it might be a good idea to use a reputable VPN so that your IP address does not leak out when you are conducting an active investigation.

This module deals with analyzing the _body_ of a malicious email, whereas the [Passive Investigation: Analyze email headers](/en/learning-path/1/module-5/) module deals with the _header_ of the email. For proper investigations, you will want to use both skills. Note that analyzing the contents and behaviors of email attachments is covered in the Malware Analysis learning path.

## Objectives

After completing this subtopic, practitioners should be able to do the following:

- Analyze the HTML code of an email and understand the basics of MIME;
- Understand and detect tracking pixels and similar active content;
- Use tools such as VirusTotal and URLScan to evaluate attachments and URLs for malicious content.

## Main Section

### Foundation Knowledge: HTML Emails and MIME

In order to practice this , you need to understand the basics of HTML emails and MIME. If you feel it’s necessary to brush up on this topic a bit, see some of the resources on key topics below:

- The majority of emails are sent in HTML format, which allows the use of various clever methods of presentation and deception by phishers.
- While it is not necessary to have the ability to write HTML or design webpages, practitioners should be comfortable opening and reviewing the source code of an HTML email and understanding the essential elements present. In order to do so, read through this introduction to [MIME ](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/exchange-server-2010/aa494197(v=exchg.140)>)and HTML emails.
- Learning some HTML is inevitable, and resources like [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) can provide a good starting point. Do also note that some mail clients (for example Outlook) do not allow you to download the whole email body.
- MIME is an Internet standard that extends the format of emails beyond plaintext emails and allows for text in character sets other than ASCII, non-text attachments, message bodies with multiple parts, and header information in non-ASCII character sets. MIME features can be abused to hide content and attach malicious content. [This Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) gives a good initial introduction.

### Identifying Potential Threats: Embedded Images and Tracking Pixels

When investigating potentially malicious emails to discover attacker infrastructure, don’t just look for links and attachments. Attackers may include trackers in their emails, just like marketers do.[ This article for marketers](https://www.nutshell.com/blog/email-tracking-pixels-101-how-do-tracking-pixels-work) explains how email tracking works. Note that any resource loaded from the web, not just images, can be used for tracking. Review the types of information which can be obtained through a tracking pixel or a tracking element, including IP (geolocation) and browser fingerprinting information. Internews created a training exercise (described in the practice section below) which will help you become more familiar with trackers and some of the information they can spot.

### Tools and Workflow for Malicious Email Analysis

Once you understand the foundational concepts and potential threats, you need a workflow and tools for analysis.

- The[ Suspicious Phishing Email](https://communitydocs.accessnow.org/58-Suspicious_Phishing_Email.html) workflow by Access Now provides a systematic approach to evaluating suspicious emails. It includes a list of steps from initial observation to threat categorization and reporting.
- [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com/) can be used to evaluate URLs and attachments for known malicious content. Note though that submitted URLs and files can be accessed by other users, and may lead to the attacker being alerted to the analysis being performed on them. This is usually only a risk during very targeted campaigns; in others, adversaries generally assume that someone detected and is analyzing their attack patterns.
- Check out [some of the email analysis tools outlined in this article](https://intezer.com/blog/incident-response/automate-analysis-phishing-email-files/). They can investigate email content and attachments and several of them are command line based, which is of particular help to analysts who are looking into content created by sophisticated actors, who might try to craft messages in ways that exploit security holes within email programs. The article also details some techniques threat actors use to frustrate analysis. [This article](https://blog.joshlemon.com.au/analysing-malicious-email-files-d85d8ff76a91) similarly looks at how to convert Outlook files to plain text ones and analyze them through a notepad or command line, so as to reduce the attack surface of malicious email which exploit Outlook bugs.

## Practice

- Read the two case studies below completely, noting all elements which are new to you and require further practice:
  - [Analyzing Malicious Email Files | by Josh Lemon | Medium](https://blog.joshlemon.com.au/analysing-malicious-email-files-d85d8ff76a91)
  - [Analyzing Malicious Emails. An intro to analyzing a phishing email | by Kyle Bubp | Medium](https://medium.com/@kylebubp/analyzing-malicious-emails-fb4ddcf0663e)
- An Internews project which focuses on journalist security [created a simulation exercise](https://internews.org/resource/guide-to-facilitating-a-technical-simulation-with-canary-tokens/) to help people better understand and practice working with trackers. Read through the project and complete some of the exercises.

## Skill Check

Ask a peer or mentor to send you an email. Ideally, the email would contain several elements such as tracking pixels, attachments, and links which would benefit from an in depth analysis. Alternatively, go into your own inbox and pick out a (hopefully) non-malicious email. Use the skills used in this module to analyze it:

- Can you read through the email headers to figure out the address of the sender?
- Can you confirm the authenticity of the sender? Is it likely that the email was spoofed?
- What infrastructure was used in the delivery of the message?
- What active content (MIME, tracking pixels) is included in the email?
- What data could be leaked by opening and interacting with the email?
- What does the sender want you to do upon receiving the email?

Discuss your answers to the above questions with your peer or mentor.
