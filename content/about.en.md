Infuse is a community-developed framework providing pathways for digital protectors (digital security trainers, technologists, auditors, etc.) to advance their knowledge and skill sets in areas of specialized technical expertise (STE). Infuse aims to make much-needed STE more widely available in contexts where at-risk communities need it the most, by upskilling protectors who already have established trust with these communities. This involves localizing expertise, as well as expanding accessibility to and increasing the diversity of providers of specialized digital security support.

The Infuse framework is being developed in response to a variety of challenges:

1. Demand for support requiring STE exceeds what is available as there is a limited pool of local digital protectors with specialized skills.
2. Digital protectors looking to upskill in areas of STE struggle to identify relevant resources, guidance, and mentorship. They also struggle to find ways to verify or validate progress made in their skill-building.
3. Resources and expertise are not equally distributed among those providing support for at-risk communities. Expertise tends to be centralized among a few, limiting the communities which can access local quality specialized support.

To address the above, Infuse provides digital protectors looking to upskill with in-depth learning paths covering different areas of STE, each associated with a badge demonstrating completion. The learning paths consist of guidance on how to best approach learning the associated area of expertise along with recommended resources. The paths each cover a variety of subtopics and include practice exercises, as well as skill validation exercises. The paths also integrate guidance on how areas of STE are relevant to and may be used to support at-risk communities. Infuse can also be used as a means of connecting with other digital protectors to aid in learning, whether they be Mentors (digital protectors who already hold expertise in a particular area) or peers learning the same area of expertise.

In 2024, Infuse is in a pilot phase, and it is still being developed and tested. During this phase, Internews in coordination with three core partners, [Conexo](https://conexo.org/en/home/), [DefendDefenders](https://defenddefenders.org/), and [Jordan Open Source Association (JOSA)](https://josa.ngo/), are supporting select Learners (digital protectors who seek to upskill using the Infuse framework) as part of a fellowship program and matching them up with a Mentor or peer Learner to help them verify their skills and provide overall guidance and support while following a learning path. The fellowship program will also present opportunities for select Learners to receive support to apply newly gained skills within their communities.

Infuse is community-developed and owned. At its core, the framework was developed based on premises, ideas, and feedback identified through interviews, focus group discussions, workshops, and sprints with dozens of digital protectors and members of the internet freedom community from across the globe. Critically, over a four-day Global Convening in Nairobi, over 25 community members contributed to the mapping of threats, mitigations, and skills which helped to determine the initial six learning paths and badge areas of expertise, in addition to insights on pedagogy, skill verification, mentorship, platform usability, and long-term sustainability of the framework. Further plans will be shared in the near future regarding long-term community ownership and maintenance of the framework.

Much like how your favorite tea infuses hot water, making for a delicious, aromatic, cozy (maybe even caffeinated) beverage, we hope that Infuse will be a rich source of learning, growth, and connection for digital protectors and the communities they support. Pinkies up!

## What is Specialized Technical Expertise (STE)?

Most digital protectors have a solid understanding of topics such as account security, secure browsing, device security, and secure messaging, and share this knowledge with their clients on a regular basis. The internet freedom community has published and localized excellent guides which cover such topics.

Specialized technical expertise (STE), on the other hand, consists of knowledge needed for more specialized, in-depth interventions and investigations, such as web security, analyzing malicious infrastructure, or investigating malware. Such areas of STE have largely not been documented and localized as comprehensively by the internet freedom community as more basic topics have been. Furthermore, STE requires not only knowledge but also specific skills, such as analyzing headers or logs, which require regular and in-depth practice.

## Who is Infuse for?

Infuse was designed to be used by digital protectors (digital security trainers, technologists, auditors, etc.) from around the world looking to upskill in areas of STE and connect with peers who can help mentor and validate skills throughout the learning process. The learning paths are not intended for absolute beginners to digital security, and to benefit from the learning paths, Learners are recommended to possess certain prerequisite skills and areas of knowledge. You will find guidance in each learning path on what those prerequisites are alongside some pointers on resources to brush up on those topics if you feel you need to.

Infuse is also a space for digital protectors who already hold expertise in a certain area of STE to be a Mentor by providing guidance and assistance with skill validation for Learners.

Additionally, any individual or organization within the digital protector community is encouraged to contribute to and maintain the framework. More information on long-term plans for community ownership and maintenance is to come, and ideas are welcome from all (email infuse@internews.org).

## How to navigate Infuse

### General instructions

Welcome to Infuse!

You will find on the Infuse website a number of ***learning paths*** which guide you through the technical journey of developing competence in the given topic. Some of these learning paths focus on different aspects of a related topic, while others stand alone. In the case of some of the linked learning paths, there may be a sequential relationship between them, where foundational skills are covered first and permit the development of deeper analysis and support skills. In any case, your **first step** will be reading the overview and prerequisites for any learning path you are interested in and selecting one by determining which is a fit for your current skill set, needs, and interests. You should also consider which learning path will upskill you in STE most relevant to needs in your community.

Each learning path opens with an overview of the learning path, an explanation of the skill being developed, its relevance to civil society, media and other high-risk user contexts for whom digital protectors serve, and prerequisites assumed to be in place before starting on the learning path.

Subsequently, the learning path is divided into sequential ***subtopics***. Most of the learning content and resources, as well as practice and skill check exercises are under the subtopic sections. They are divided into the following sections:

* ***Use Case:*** The *when* and the *why* of the skill. Understand the reason to advance yourself in this skill and the scenarios in which you might apply it.
* ***Objectives:*** The specific capabilities and realizations of knowledge and ability which define the accomplishment of this subtopic.
* **Body / *Main Text of the Subtopic***: Here you will find the main guidance to the topic, including sub-sections as relevant such as foundational knowledge, technical explanations and contextualization, outlinks to external learning resources, assignments, external courses, and info boxes. To make proper use of Infuse, you must do the activities as recommended, not simply read the text of the subtopic or glance at the linked resources. You should be able to complete the subsequent practice and skill check exercises (see below).
* ***Learning Resources***: A round-up of guides and resources linked in the main text with additional metadata about resource language, cost, and other details.
* ***Practice Exercises***: A collection of practical opportunities, simulations, samples, or suggested exercises to allow you to practice and implement the skills contained in the subtopic.
* ***Skill Check Exercises:*** Suggested challenges, tests, abilities, or mentor-assisted processes to validate the realization or state of progress on the subtopic. Note that these have been written to be used either for a self-guided Learner as well as for a Learner working with a Mentor to help guide their progress.

Subtopics within a learning path may contain sections focusing on individual operating system platforms. You can consider these as individual ‘flavors’ of the learning path and may choose to focus on one or multiple operating system environments depending on your needs.

In general we envision that all subtopics within a learning path are relevant to a digital protector, however there may be cases where a subtopic is marked as optional for the Learner to complete.

### Skill verification and mentorship

STE isn't just about knowledge and facts, but also about skills which require practice and need to be kept up-to-date. It can sometimes prove difficult for a Learner to figure out whether they mastered a skill in enough depth to be able to use it to support others. Every learning path therefore contains a series of skill validation exercises, usually at least one per subtopic. These are practical questions which aim to resemble the type of work a digital protector using STE would do when supporting their beneficiaries. They are further complemented by practice exercises, readings, and mini courses.

As part of Infuse, Learners may also work with Mentors who will verify how well they have understood the content and how ready they are to support others using the knowledge and skills they have learned. Still, since not all Learners might be able to receive constant support from Mentors, many of the skill verification exercises can also be done by Learners working on their own or with help from a peer digital protector.

### Badges

After working through a learning path and accomplishing validation criteria (skill checks) through the verification of a Mentor or peer, you are considered to have earned the ***badge*** relevant to that learning path. The Infuse team is working to develop an online platform to host the Infuse framework, and this website will include a system for badge-earners to demonstrate and explain their badge to their professional networks and communities they work with.

Infuse will also be developing and sharing a ***scorecard*** template (each customized for a particular learning path) that can be used by a Mentor or peer Learner to track a Learner’s satisfactory completion of each subtopic’s skill check and determine their acquisition of the badge.

### Translation

At this time, Infuse materials (i.e., this introduction, the learning paths, and resources included in the learning paths) are solely available in English. That being said, Infuse is intended for a global audience, and inclusion of a diversity of language speakers is critical. The initial six learning paths (Malicious Infrastructure, Malware Detection, Malware Analysis, Web Application Fundamentals, Web Application Assessment, and Web Application Web Application Attack Preparation, Forensics, and Incident Response), as well as this introduction to Infuse, will be translated into Arabic, French, and Spanish in 2024. Select resources linked out from the learning path will also be translated into different languages in 2024 based on demand. If you have any recommendations for resources to translate, please contact infuse@internews.org. There are certainly limitations in terms of language accessibility, and your feedback and ideas for improvement are welcome.

### Notes on integration of interpersonal & pedagogical skills

Working effectively as a digital protector involves much more than technical skills and knowledge. Supporting activists, journalists, public figures, social movements, and their organizations means politically engaging with their advocacy directions and empathetically engaging with their lived experiences of risk and their unavoidable entanglements with technology. The Infuse learning paths were written and contributed to by experienced digital protectors with experience of balancing technical, interpersonal, and pedagogical needs in their support work in advocacy-driven communities and organizations. As such, the guides include content and subtopics on operational security, interpersonal skills, and pedagogical considerations for engaging with your clients. These are integral skills, and we urge you not to skip over them in favor of technical topics. As you engage these topics, think about your own personal and cultural context - not everybody has genius-level emotional intelligence (EQ), but we can all do better work with empathy, care, and diligence when working with high-risk individuals, and we hope some of the guidance in the learning paths is helpful to inform strategies to do so. May your best values and intentions infuse your work as a digital protector!

### A note on some language choices in Infuse

Throughout the text of this resource you may note that we have selected some language which may or may not feel right to you. We recognize that some of these choices will not ring true to everyone and wanted to explain some of the considerations behind those choices. We also recognize that some of the nuance behind the decisions may not hold true in non-English languages, and have tried to work with professional translators to make similarly considered language choices in those versions.

**‘Clients’** - Presumably a digital protector is working with and for some other person. Some ways of describing that person/group could be *beneficiaries, interlocutor, community-member, victim,* or *target* (see below). While ‘Client’ felt somewhat cold and business-like, we did appreciate the clarity of the relationship of the service being provided, to underline the professional nature of digital protector work, and wanted to avoid the value-assumption and humanitarian framing of ‘beneficiary’.

(not) ‘**Victims**’ - We have avoided the use of the term ‘Victims’ (or ‘target’) in reference to the person targeted by spyware, malware, or other negative incidents. We found this term to be stigmatizing and condescending. Instead, we have opted for slightly more wordy variations such as ‘the person who received the phishing email’, or ‘the owner of the infected device’, or simply ‘your client’ (see above).

You may find an interchangeable usage of the terms **Learner** and **Practitioner** in reference to the intended audience of these learning paths. We do expect the audience of this material to be practicing digital protection and technical support to at-risk persons already, thus consider ‘Practitioner’ to be a recognition of their (your) expertise and contribution. At the same time, we are all lifelong learners and we did want to highlight that this is a moment and opportunity to advance skills and make the difficult sacrifice of time to prioritize learning.

THAT'S ALL, FOLKS!
